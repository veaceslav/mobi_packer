The application takes a filename as argument and displays the item in the bag.

How to run:
1. Open the project with Intellij IDEA(Community Edition)

Dependencies:
1. OpenJDK 8
1. Junit 4 (taken form Maven)

Application Design:
1. Read the file line by line 
2. Validate each line with a regex, throw exception if necessare (Pack.packInternals)
3. Parse maxWeight and split in item substring.
4. Each item substring is validated with another regex, and throw exception if it is not matched or constrains are not satisfier(utils.MyParser)
5. Multiply weights by 100 to make them integers
6. Run Knapsack algorithm (dynamic programming)
7. Format the output and display the result
